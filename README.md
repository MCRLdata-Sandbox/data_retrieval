# data_retrieval
Pull data on-demand. Data are organized by quality control (QC) level: 

 - L1 - data are flagged for obvious issues, but no data are removed
 - L2 - data that were flagged are removed, and additional data-specific QC has been applied

**Disclaimer: L2 does NOT imply all data are "good"! Data QC is a spectrum, all users are responsible for understanding the data quality needed for their use-case!**
