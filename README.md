# data_retrieval
Pull data on-demand. Data are organized by quality control (QC) level: 

 - L1 - data are flagged for obvious issues, but no data are removed
 - L2 - data that were flagged are removed, and additional data-specific QC has been applied

🏖️ Note: If this is <ins>your first time here</ins>, or you have questions about the whys, whats, and hows, please start with the **[sandbox_intro](https://github.com/MCRLdata-Sandbox/.github/blob/main/sandbox_intro.md)**

## How do you want to retrieve data?

If you want to directly download L1 datasets, please visit the [data_prep L1 folder](https://github.com/MCRLdata-Sandbox/data_prep/tree/main/data/outputs/L1)

**Disclaimer: Data QC is a relative term, all users are responsible for understanding the data quality needed for their use-case and using provided data accordingly**
